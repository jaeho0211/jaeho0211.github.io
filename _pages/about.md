I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in [Arbabian Lab](https://arbabianlab.stanford.edu) (PI: Prof. Amin Arbarbian) at EE, [**Stanford University**](https://ee.stanford.edu), Stanford, CA, USA. 

I completed my Ph.D/M.S. at EE, [**POSTECH**](https://eee.postech.ac.kr), Korea (advised by Prof. Kyung-Tae Kim). I did my B.S. at CS, [**Korea University**](https://cs.korea.edu/en_cs/index.do), Korea.

My research interests lie in **Wireless Sensing with Machine Learning**, including RF-based localization, crowd counting, contactless health monitoring, and SAR-based perception. I am also interested in the **Computer Vision** and **Sensor Fusion** algorithms.
